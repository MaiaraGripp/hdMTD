Title: Inference for High-Dimensional Mixture Transition Distribution (MTD) Models
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: c(person(given = "Maiara", family = "Gripp", email = "maiara@dme.ufrj.br", role = c("aut", "cre")), person(given = "Guilherme", family = "Ost", email = "guilhermeost@im.ufrj.br", role = "ths"), person(given = "Giulio", family = "Iacobelli", email = "giulio@im.ufrj.br", role = "ths"))
Description: Provides several statistical tools to estimate the parameters of MTD models. It also includes an algorithm to exactly simulate samples of an MTD model from its stationary distribution. For more details see Ost, G. and Takahashi, D. Y. (2023) <http://jmlr.org/papers/v24/22-0266.html>.
